\section{Early History}
\label{sec:history}

Hardware acceleration has a long history.  In 1984, Blank~\cite{Blank84}
published a survey of hardware accelerators used in computer-aided design 
that described a set of special-purpose engines going back nearly 20 years
(the first being described in 1969~\cite{McKay69}).

First FPGA and GPU~\cite{khdo06}.

Early machine~\cite{kdh+06}.

Development environment~\cite{cft+10},
included FPGA hardware but no empirical FPGA results~\cite{dy08}.

Cluster~\cite{tl10}, cluster (w/GRAPE)~\cite{sbm+09}.

Early applications~\cite{bkdb10,khdo06,shsc08,tl10}.

Map-reduce~\cite{ytt+08} (both, but not simultaneously).

Compare: GPU vs.~FPGA~\cite{bnw+10,cls+08,cmhm10,cz09,jpbc10,sww+10,tb10},
PRNG~\cite{thl09,tb09}, SPICE~\cite{kd09}, image processing~\cite{amy09}.
Productivity measures~\cite{jpbc10}.

Early review~\cite{bdh+10}.
